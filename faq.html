            <div class="question">
                <h3 onclick="toggleAns(this)">What happens in Consultation session?</h3>
                <p>Your therapist will gather information about your general health, recent injuries, and goals to start with, then you will be asked to perform some tests. The results will be explained to you, and your treatment/exercise plan will be made according to your assessment results and your goals.

            <div class="question">
                <h3 onclick="toggleAns(this)">Do you offer manual therapy?</h3>
                <p>At our clinic, we emphasize active treatment and movement therapy as the foundation of recovery. While we recognize that passive treatments, such as pain management through various modalities, can be beneficial in the early stages of an injury, our focus is on helping clients regain their daily function through purposeful movement. Our physiotherapy sessions prioritize active treatments and exercises, with guidance for managing acute injuries. Our goal is to help you get back on track as quickly as possible—so get ready to move with us!
